## Hey Folks, I'm Dhruv - Junior Data Scientist ðŸ‘‹

## Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and passion purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.
_Note: Data used in the projects are taken from several websites followed by courses through Udemy and Coursera instructor._

## I'm a Learner, Friend, Developer,and Dreamer!!

- ðŸ”­ Soon in this year, a complete features of AI application on improving text data and grammer check will be released !
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep learning specialization with the combination of NLP in the Finance,Banking and Health sector  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other content creators
- ðŸ¥… 2021 Goals: To contribute more and connect with others

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Seattle Housing Prices](https://github.com/Dhruv876/House-Prediction-and-Dataset-Analysis/blob/master/Keras_Regression.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing neural network algorithm.Various data visualization plots are done to figure out the top 1% of highest house price location on the Seattle, USA map.
  - [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/Dhruv876/Extensive-Visualization-of-the-Heart-Disease-classification/blob/main/Heart_Disease_Prediction_%26_Visualization.ipynb):A model to predict the presence of heart disease in the patient. Clearly depicted the male and female disease variations through visualization plots. Moreover, applied various machine learning algorithms to check the highest accuracy of the model.
  - [Bank Loan Repayment](https://github.com/Dhruv876/Neural-Network-with-prediction-of-bank-loan-payment/blob/master/Lending%20Club%20Dataset.ipynb): Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can to build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. 
  [Supervised learning on Breast Cancer](https://github.com/Dhruv876/Breast-Cancer/blob/master/Keras_Classification.ipynb): Working on binary classification label, to predict whether the patient has breast cancer or not.Passing the scaled features through the neural network.
  [Data Mining on Liver-Fibrosis](https://github.com/Dhruv876/Prediction-of-liver-fibrosis-/blob/master/project.py): This was a group project, in which we used data mining techniques to distinguish the dataset and to predict whether the patient has liver fibrosis or not. Using the features in machine learning algorithms to check the best output.
