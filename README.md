## Hey Folks, I'm Dhruv - Junior Data Scientist 👋

## Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and passion purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.
_Note: Data used in the projects are taken from several websites followed by courses through Udemy and Coursera instructor._ In content section each folder is allocated and contains several sub projects.

## I'm a Learner, Friend, Developer,and Dreamer!!

- 🔭 Soon in this year, a complete features of AI application on improving text data and grammer check will be released !
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep learning specialization with the combination of NLP in the Finance,Banking and Health sector  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other content creators
- 🥅 2021 Goals: To contribute more and connect with others
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am fitness freak
- 👯 This page is always under construction

## Contents
- [Deep Learning Projects/Neural Network](https://github.com/Dhruv876/Neural-Network): In this folder there are sub projects. It helped me to understand the foundations of deep learning. Able to build, apply, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks. In this folder there are several projects about house price prediction, breast cancer classification and bank loan repayment. Libraries [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Neural Network](https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414).
- [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/Dhruv876/Convolutional-Neural-Network): In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.There are three sub projects in this repository.Libraries [CNN](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/), [Image Data processing](https://keras.io/api/preprocessing/image/). 
- [Computer Vision](https://github.com/Dhruv876/Computer-Vision): Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.There is only one project right now and Library used is [OpenCV2](https://opencv.org/). 
- [Machine Learning Micro Projects](https://github.com/Dhruv876/Machine-Learning-Micro-Projects):Machine-learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive* amounts of data. And data, here, encompasses a lot of things—numbers, words, images, clicks, what have you. If it can be digitally stored, it can be fed into a machine-learning algorithm.It contains several projects and libaries used are from [All algorithms](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Data Analysis and Visualization]https://github.com/Dhruv876/Data-Analysis-and-Visualization): Extraction, EDA, Data Manipulation, Data wrangling and Data Visualization. Libraries like  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html), [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/trial/tableau-software?utm_campaign_id=2017049&utm_campaign=Prospecting-CORE-ALL-ALL-ALL-ALL&utm_medium=Paid+Search&utm_source=Google+Search&utm_language=EN&utm_country=USCA&kw=tableau&adgroup=CTX-Brand-Priority-Core-E&adused=RESP&matchtype=e&placement=&gclid=CjwKCAiAuoqABhAsEiwAdSkVVEf1cgmCvv6TQCeDhSfYSuv5vL2cYOjykVcdorSu7qYE9LxHjTcQaBoCTzQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).
