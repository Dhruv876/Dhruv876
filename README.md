## Hey Folks, I'm Dhruv - Junior Data Scientist 👋

## Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and passion purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.
_Note: Data used in the projects are taken from several websites followed by courses through Udemy and Coursera instructor._ In content section each folder is allocated and contains several sub projects.

## I'm a Learner, Friend, Developer,and Dreamer!!

- 🔭 Soon in this year, a complete features of AI application on improving text data and grammer check will be released !
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep learning specialization with the combination of NLP in the Finance,Banking and Health sector  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other content creators
- 🥅 2021 Goals: To contribute more and connect with others
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am fitness freak
- 👯 This page is always under construction
